# Lab 2

This is an introductory lab, therefore it is not recommended to include tests.

These exercises heavily rely upon `print` and `input` functions, using `stdout` and `stdin` respectively. 
This makes them difficult if not impossible to set up with unit tests.

Only `stdout` can be captured; faking `input` is tricky if not impossible.
