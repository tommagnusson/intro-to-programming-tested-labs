# Lab 8

This is a possible candidate for testing, however testing all the permutations of different outputs is quite tedious, and the way that the AI reacts is up to each students, so perhaps requiring tests to demonstrate one or two reactions would be appropriate.

This lab feels like it should have a less manual solution (than creating your own matrix manually) however I did not see any. Perhaps limiting the number of possible emotions would convey the same coding skills without requiring students to define large matrix.
